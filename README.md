# Library-Book-Logger

This was a lot harder than I thought. As of April 8th, 2023, I've managed to make the logger place the books in the library in the proper order but haven't finished the final touches in JS and CSS. 

But I'll be back once I'm more experienced in other areas i.e. local/cloud storage. 

Got a long ways to go, but I'm happy with the steps I took here.
